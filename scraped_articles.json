Abbas, who goes by \u201cHushpuppi,\u201d has long flaunted his wealth to his 2.5 million Instagram followers. Helicopters, Gucci, Fendi and fancy cars \u2014 it\u2019s all part of his social-media persona.\n\nApparently, this kind of stuff resonates:\n\nIt turns out that lavish lifestyle wasn\u2019t the result of his savvy as a real-estate developer, as his self-billing claims. No, according to CNN, a federal affidavit alleges that his riches were financed by hacking major companies across the U.S. and Europe.\n\nAbbas, a Nigerian national, was arrested in his luxe Dubai residence last month and flown to Chicago on July 2, where he awaits transfer to Los Angeles. There he is to face accusations of conspiring to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through cybercrime schemes, CNN reported.\n\nAlong with multiple alleged co-conspirators, Abbas allegedly used computer intrusions, business email compromise schemes and money laundering to steal hundreds of millions of dollars. Snap Inc. SNAP, -5.05% , Facebook FB, -2.47% unit Instagram and Apple AAPL, -0.46% reportedly helped the FBI make connections among chat histories, phone contacts and email addresses.\n\nCNN explained that this birthday post, for instance, helped authorities track him down, with federal law enforcement reportedly using it to verify his date of birth on a previous visa application:\n\nInvestigators reportedly seized during its arrest of Abbas and 11 others some $41 million along with 13 luxury cars worth almost $7 million. The investigation reportedly uncovered the email addresses of nearly 2 million possible victims.\n\nThe alleged cybercrime victims include a paralegal at a New York law firm said to have wired about $923,000 meant for a client\u2019s real-estate refinancing to a bank account controlled by Abbas and his co-conspirators. The wire instructions were fraudulent, and the bank\u2019s email address was \u201cspoofed.\u201d\n\nAbbas is also accused of trying to steal $124 million from an unnamed English Premier League soccer club, though CNN reported that it\u2019s unknown whether he was successful.\n\nIf convicted of money laundering, he would face up to 20 years in prison."}, {"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B16449DEC-C2D0-11EA-9309-095339FF535B%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-07-13T20:47:43", "title": "S&P 500 earnings set to plunge as the coronavirus batters all sectors \u2014 with Wall Street counting on a bounce that may not come", "text": "The one certainty about the outlook for companies in a COVID-19 world is that second-quarter earnings will be very bad \u2014 the worst, in fact, in more than 10 years.\n\nAlthough Wall Street is betting that earnings will start bouncing off the bottom in the third quarter, the beginning point for that bounce is unknown, and early indications suggest the rebound\u2019s magnitude may not match investors\u2019 hopes.\n\nAs usual ahead of earnings season, since the reports cover the three-month period that has already passed, what companies say about the current quarter or the full year is more important than the results they\u2019re reporting. But this earnings season may be different, as uncertainty over the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led many companies to withdraw guidance, leaving analysts more blinkered than usual when setting estimates.\n\nAbout a third of S&P 500 SPX, -0.93% component companies have pulled their financial guidance, and less than half the typical number of companies have so far provided quarterly updates ahead of earnings, according to Sebastien Leburn, senior portfolio manager at Boston Private. \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit of information that needs to be filled at some point,\u201d Leburn said in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nThat puts the trajectory of the anticipated earnings bounce, which stock investors are banking on, on unsure footing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I think earnings will be very important, because they\u2019ll provide a dose of reality,\u201d Brad Cornell, professor emeritus of finance at UCLA, told MarketWatch. \u201cThey are going to tell us exactly whether a company is on a path that justifies this run-up.\u201d\n\nOne aspect of the rally in stocks over the past few months is that it has been driven by a shrinking set of mega-capitalization companies expected to benefit in a post\u2013COVID-19 world. All five of the most highly valued companies in the S&P 500 index \u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.46% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -3.08% , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.00% , Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -1.74% GOOGL, -1.74% and Facebook Inc. FB, -2.47% \u2014 have rallied by a double-digit percentage in 2020 through Friday, while the S&P 500 has lost 1.4%.\n\n\u201c \u2018That\u2019s why I think earnings will be very important, because they\u2019ll provide a dose of reality. They are going to tell us exactly whether a company is on a path that justifies this run-up.\u201d \u201d \u2014 Brad Cornell, UCLA\n\nThose five companies have a combined weighting of more than 20% in the index, according to data provided by FactSet. That increases the risk for the broader stock market, as it heightens the importance of the earnings performance of a smaller set of companies. Disappointing results from other companies viewed as post\u2013COVID-19 winners could also sap the market\u2019s strength.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the results that matter; so will any financial guidance they can provide to help justify the stocks\u2019 gains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about clarity and having some guidance,\u201d said Boston Private\u2019s Leburn. \u201cWithout that, you have nothing to work with.\u201d\n\nThe bad news is the actual numbers\n\nThe second-quarter earnings reporting season for S&P 500 companies unofficially kicks off before Tuesday\u2019s opening bell, when a number of banks reveal their results.\n\nDon\u2019t miss:What to expect as banks report earnings: more loan pain but plenty of fee income\n\nThe aggregate blended year-over-year growth estimate for earnings per share, which includes some earnings already reported and the average analyst estimates of coming results, is negative 44.6% as of Monday morning, according to FactSet. That would be the biggest decline in earnings since the fourth quarter of 2008, when earnings fell 70% in the midst of the financial crisis. It would follow 1% earnings growth in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cSecond-quarter earnings will likely be a \u2018kitchen sink\u2019 report from many companies,\u201d said Marc Lichtenfeld, chief income strategist with the investment and business newsletter publisher the Oxford Club. \u201cThey can throw in all of their write-offs and other expenses and know they will likely be forgiven for an earnings miss due to the extenuating circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe current estimate marks a sharp drop in expectations as the coronavirus pandemic took firmer hold: The estimate as of March 31 was for a decline of just 11.1%.\n\nAll 11 S&P 500 sectors are expected to suffer negative earnings growth, led by energy, where earnings are projected to have fallen 152.6%, and consumer discretionary, which includes Amazon, where a 118.0% decline is forecast. Financials, which kicks off earnings reporting season on Tuesday, are expected to see a 55.3% earnings drop.\n\nInformation technology, which includes Apple and Microsoft, is expected to show a 9.5% earnings decline, while communications services, which houses Alphabet and Facebook, is expected to fall 30.4%. The best performer is currently estimated to be the utilities sector, whose earnings are forecast to be down 1.8%.\n\nThe outlook for sales is much better, with analyst expectations pointing to an 11.0% decline overall, with health care and utilities are the two sectors projected to see year-over-year sales growth.\n\nThe outlook for the third quarter is also bleak, just not as bleak as the second quarter.\n\nThe blended earnings-per-share estimate is for a drop of 24.4%, which compares with expectations of a decline of just 1% as of March 31. That would mark a second straight quarter of negative earnings growth, which by definition would mark the kickoff of an earnings recession.\n\nThat implies a bounce that recovers less that half the earnings lost since the first quarter. In comparison, the S&P 500 has retraced about 82% through Friday, of the COVID-19 selloff from the Feb. 19 record-high close of 3,386.15 to the March 23 closing low of 2,237.40.\n\nAll 11 S&P 500 sectors are currently projected to suffer negative third-quarter earnings growth, led by energy at down 113.5% and industrials at down 59.9%. The best expected performer is utilities, at a 0.1%earnings decline.\n\nMeanwhile, third-quarter sales are expected to decline at a 5.5% rate.\n\nWinners and losers in a new world\n\nAlthough the earnings outlook for the overall S&P 500 is uniformly negative, investors have made a clear distinction between companies expected to end up as winners in a post\u2013COVID-19 world and those that will struggle.\n\nMany believe the COVID crisis is creating a new world, while others believe the pandemic has just sped up the future.\n\n\u201cHistorically speaking, crises have tended to accelerate macro trends already in place,\u201d said Yancey Spruill, chief executive officer at DigitalOcean, a cloud infrastructure company. \u201cThe clear winners are enterprise technology companies whose infrastructure or software supports the shift to remote work environments and deliver services to customers in a low-friction manner through an internet-based interface.\u201d\n\nIn this world, Spruill views Okta Inc. OKTA, -8.52% , Atlassian Corp. TEAM, -6.48% , Twilio Inc. TWLO, -6.50% and ServiceNow Inc. NOW, -4.97% as cloud productivity tools that will likely continue to see \u201cimpressive growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoronavirus has split the stock market like never before,\u201d said David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at TradeStation Group. \u201cLarge swaths of the S&P 500 and even some members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.04% have become irrelevant as newer software companies break out.\u201d\n\nA good example is Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM, -5.64% , Russell said. The video meetings service, which went public just 15 months ago, has a market capitalization of about $78 billion, which is bigger than the market caps of two hotel stocks in the S&P 500 \u2014 Marriott International Inc. MAR, -1.14% and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. HLT, -2.20% \u2014 combined, and bigger than the market caps of six Dow components, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +1.61% and Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +2.03% .\n\nInvestors also seem to be betting on socially conscious companies following environmental, social and governance, or ESG, criteria.\n\n\u201cWe were already seeing a shift of money into ESG funds before coronavirus, and the trend has continued with an embrace of electric vehicles and solar energy,\u201d Russell said.\n\nOpinion:Coronavirus can shake up ESG investing \u2014 here\u2019s what investors should demand\n\nFor example, Tesla Inc. TSLA, -3.08% is not yet a member of the S&P 500, but with the stock more than tripling this year, the electric-vehicle maker\u2019s market cap of about $276 billion makes it the 15th most valuable company in the U.S.\n\nCOVID trumps political unknowns\n\nOne potential headwind for the stock market is the cloud of uncertainty blanketing the political landscape, in terms of what shape the next stimulus package, if one emerges, will take in the shorter term, and the Nov. 3 presidential election in the medium and longer terms.\n\nSee:Goodbye, extra $600: Unemployment benefits won\u2019t exceed former wages in next stimulus bill, Treasury\u2019s Mnuchin says\n\n\u201cPolitics will undoubtedly play a role in the outlook and guidance for Q3,\u201d said Ken Van Leeuwen, managing director and founder of the financial adviser Van Leeuwen & Co. \u201cThe current news cycle has been dominated by COVID-19\u2013related [developments] and social unrest, but we feel that the election will be in the spotlight as we get closer to November.\u201d\n\nThis could make it difficult for companies to provide investors with the clarity they\u2019re desiring. And a continued reluctance to provide guidance could shake the stock market\u2019s foundation.\n\n\u201cThe continued information deficit can\u2019t get stocks in trouble,\u201d said Boston Private\u2019s Leburn.\n\nOthers believe that politics is just a sideshow that can create short-term volatility for stocks, while lasting impacts are unlikely. Especially in the current environment.\n\n\u201c[T]he tremendous health and economic challenges associated with the COVID-19 outbreak mean that election-related political uncertainty isn\u2019t the primary concern of business leaders,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. \u201cThey have other proverbial fish to fry at the moment.\u201d\n\nCost cutting and capital raising\n\nInvestors can brace for a fresh round of cost cuts and capital-raising activity to accompany earnings reports, as companies move to bolster liquidity and preserve cash as revenue shrinks.\n\nCompanies in the hospitality sector \u2014 restaurants, hotels, airlines, and rental-car companies \u2014 are most at risk, said Anthony Denier, chief executive of Webull, a commission-free trading platform. \u201cCompanies related to sports, such as Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. MSGS, -1.84% , will also take a hit. Entertainment companies like casinos and anything that puts on shows where large groups of people attend will also be hit hard.\u201d\n\nThe handful of companies that have already reported or updated guidance reflect the trend.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -1.34% announced it plans to cut 4,000 jobs in the U.K., and United Airlines may furlough or fire up to 36,000 employees once the federal rules for accepting pandemic money expires on Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cThis could expand throughout the entire airline sector,\u201d said Denier. \u201cAT&T also said it may cut jobs and close stores. Again, this might be a harbinger for the rest of the telecommunications industry.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018There\u2019s so much liquidity and capital to put to work and so much trading on short-term trends and issues. It belies the underlying weakness and problems to come and it\u2019s whitewashing many of those problems.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 James Gellert, Rapid Ratings\n\nOther companies to shrink head count include jeans maker Levi Strauss & Co. LEVI, -1.66% , audience-measurement company Nielsen Holdings PLC NLSN, +0.41% , motorbike maker Harley Davidson Inc. HOG, -1.70% and hamburger chain Shake Shack Inc. SHAK, +0.76% , which has failed to fully offset restaurant closures with delivery and pickup.\n\nJames Gellert, CEO of Rapid Ratings, a data and analytics company that assesses the financial health of private and public companies, said the quarter will reveal just how much companies have been destabilized by the pandemic \u2014 and it won\u2019t be pretty.\n\nRapid Ratings conducted stress tests on 40,000 public and private companies, reviewing their financial health ratings prior to their first-quarter earnings releases to establish a true pre\u2013COVID-19 perspective and measure how much they deteriorated after stay-at-home orders were put in place.\n\nThe stress tests showed deterioration in core health, which looks at longer-term stability, while shorter-term financial health ratings were not as badly impacted, \u201cbut I suspect after the second quarter we will see a precipitous decline in both,\u201d said Gellert.\n\nOverall, companies increased leverage, while revenue and profitability declined. That means higher interest costs but lower interest coverage amid a reduction in cash from operations.\n\n\u201cThat combination of factors sets the stage for an enormously impactful second quarter,\u201d he said.\n\nEven after raising money at record rates, companies are expected to continue to issue debt, equity and convertible bonds in the coming quarters, as long as capital markets remain open.\n\nU.S. companies issued a stunning $1.09 trillion of corporate bonds in 909 deals in the year through July 10, according to data provided by Dealogic. That shattered the previous record of $670.7 billion in 664 deals issued in 2015.\n\nCompanies issued $252.2 billion of equity in 659 deals, the Dealogic data show, trouncing the previous record of $206.1 billion in 599 deals issued in 2000.\n\nConvertible bond issuance also set a record, of $180.4 billion in 543 deals, breaking the previous mark of $185.9 billion in 550 deals set in 2000.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much liquidity and capital to put to work and so much trading on short-term trends and issues,\u201d said Gellert. \u201cIt belies the underlying weakness and problems to come, and it\u2019s whitewashing many of those problems.\u201d\n\nCrucially, buoyant capital markets are not reflecting the underlying weakness to come and the problem of long-term destabilization. \u201cNobody should equate strength in the S&P 500 with underlying corporate strength,\u201d Gellert said."}, {"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BCD5166BC-C50C-11EA-ADBD-E48A6864D1D3%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-07-13T20:47:08", "title": "Coronavirus update: Global case tally edges toward 13 million, and Florida trounces one-day case record set by California last week", "text": "The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus illness COVID-19 worldwide edged closer to 13 million on Monday, a day after the World Health Organization reported another one-day case record above 230,000, and Florida set a U.S. record that trounced the previous one set by California last week.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Department of Health reported 15,299 people tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, bumping the total confirmed case tally for the Sunshine State to 269,811 cases, as the Associated Press reported. The previous record was 11,694 cases in a single day, set last week by California.\n\nIn more bad news, Florida counted a record of 514 fatalities last week, compared with the average of 30 deaths a day the state was recording just three weeks ago. Testing has doubled in the past month to almost 50,000 a day from 25,000 and the percentage of people testing positive has risen to an average of 19% in the last week from few than 5% a month ago, the AP reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Arizona continues to clamor for help with testing as its hospitals are becoming overwhelmed. In Texas, the mayor of Houston Sylvester Turner and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, both Democrats, said a stay-at-home order is needed to help the city cope with its recent surge in cases. State health officials reported 8,196 new cases Sunday, another 80 deaths and a total of 10,410 people hospitalized due to the virus, as the AP reported.\n\n\u201cNot only do we need a stay home order now, but we need to stick with it this time until the hospitalization curve comes down, not just flattens,\u201d Hidalgo said on Twitter Sunday. \u201cMany communities that persevered in that way are reopening for the long haul. Let\u2019s learn from that & not make the same mistake twice.\u201d\n\nA 30-year old in Texas died after attending a so-called \u201cCOVID-19 party,\u201d telling nurses he thought the virus was a hoax, the New York Times reported.\n\nPresident Donald Trump wore a face mask while visiting a military hospital on Saturday, but his administration continued to criticize and point fingers at a key member of the White House Task Force set up to manage the pandemic. Trump himself got the ball rolling in an interview with Fox News Anchor Sean Hannity, in which he said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases and the man deemed to be the nation\u2019s leading infectious-disease expert, \u201cis a nice man, but he\u2019s made a lot of mistakes.\u201d\n\nAdm. Brett Giroir said Sunday on NBC News show \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Fauci \u201cis not 100% right, and he also doesn\u2019t necessarily, he admits that, have the whole national interest in mind.\u201d Giroir is testing coordinator at the Department of Health and Human Services, and was being questioned about a Washington Post report that said Fauci has argued states with spikes should shut down again.\n\nGiroir said he doesn\u2019t \u201cthink we need to shut down\u201d again \u2014 \u201cat least in most places around the country\u201d but suggested Americans \u201cavoid bars\u201d and \u201cwear a mask in public.\u201d\n\nFauci is not the only public health expert arguing there is a need for another shutdown.\n\n\u201cSomehow we thought that we could basically win an argument with this virus and now we know we can\u2019t,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, head of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, in a weekend interview with MSNBC.\n\nOn Monday, he said it\u2019s too late for people who have already become infected. \u201cThose people are already in the pipeline. The next two weeks ... that history is already written,\u201d Osterholm said in another MSNBC interview.\n\n\u201cLet me just say I\u2019m not a politician; I\u2019m a scientist. and frankly I\u2019m frustrated by this entire situation because the more minutes we spend talking about this, the less we\u2019re spending talking to people about distancing, about the importance of why cases even in young adults are leading to a number of intensive-care-unit hospitalizations and deaths, why what we have to do is make sure that when you\u2019re in indoor-air settings like bars and restaurants you put yourself at high risk of transmitting this virus, why it is so important,\u201d he said.\n\nOsterholm estimates that the number of Americans already infected is at 7% or 8%, far from the 50% to 70% required \u201cthat will be required to get infected or be vaccinated and be protected in order to slow this virus transmission down.\u201d\n\nOsterholm has consistently argued said the U.S. needs to go back to Square One, shut down, reopen gradually, like early hot spot New York and the rest of the world, and then live with COVID-19 until a vaccine has been developed\n\nOn Monday, New York City officials reported the first day of zero COVID-19 deaths since the start of the outbreak.\n\nLatest tallies\n\nThere are now 12.9 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and the U.S. accounts for about a quarter or 3.31 million, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. At least 569,878 people have died of the illness and at least 7.1 million have recovered.\n\nThe U.S. has the highest death toll at 135,213. A Harvard Global Health Institute researchers\u2019 national tracker created to trace the severity of the outbreak on a state-by-state basis is flashing red for eight states, namely Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, Texas, Georgia, Alabama and Idaho.\n\nBrazil is second to the U.S. with 1.86 million cases and 72,100 deaths.\n\nSee: Tax us: Abigail Disney among 83 millionaires begging for higher taxes for coronavirus relief\n\nIndia is third measured by cases at 878,254, followed by Russia with 726,826 and Peru with 326,326.\n\nThe U.K. has 291,155 cases and 44,904 fatalities, the highest in Europe and third highest in the world.

US:ENZ received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for its COVID-19 diagnostic test. The regulator issued the EUA on July 7. It has granted emergency authorization to at least 137 diagnostic tests during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhat are companies saying?\n\nPepsiCo Inc. US:PEP reported second-quarter profit and revenue that fell less than expected, as snacks and food business remained resilient amid the pandemic.\n\nNet income fell to $1.65 billion, or $1.18 a share, from $2.04 billion, or $1.44 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, core earnings per share came to $1.32, above the FactSet consensus of $1.25. Revenue fell 3.1% to $15.95 billion, but topped the FactSet consensus of $15.37 billion.\n\nFrito-Lay North America revenue rose 6.6% to $4.27 billion, beverages North America revenue fell 6.6% to $4.97 billion and Quaker Foods North America revenue grew 23.0% to $664 million.\n\nThe company said it was not providing full-year financial guidance given the uncertainties associated with the pandemic, but said it plans to return $7.5 billion to shareholders through dividends of $5.5 billion and stock repurchases of about $2 billion.\n\nGoldman Sachs initiated coverage of Walt Disney Co. stock US:DIS with a buy rating and $137 price target, amid high hopes that its streaming service could amass more than 150 million Disney+ streaming subscribers by 2025. The company had 54.5 million subscribers as of early May.\n\nThe company is \u201crapidly emerging as a global leader in direct-to-consumer entertainment,\u201d analyst Brett Feldman wrote, and he argued that the consensus view underestimates the profit potential for Disney+.

US:AMC has reached an agreement to reduce its debt by at least $460 million and has secured $300 million in new funding. The company, which has been battered during the pandemic as it was forced to close its theaters, said it has amended exchange offer and other agreements to reduce its debt by up to $630 million with holders of 73% of its roughly $2.3 billion in senior subordinated notes supporting an amendment announced late Friday. Separately, the company has reached agreements to restructure some $600 million of convertible bonds issued in 2018 to Silver Lake. In another liquidity-boosting move, AMC has converted cash interest on new exchange notes for 12 months, and under certain conditions up to 18 months, into payment-in-kind and they will be deferred until 2026. The company could save $100 million to $200 million of cash in the near term. \u201cThis is one of many steps we have taken since March as we navigate through these turbulent coronavirus times, including significantly reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, working with theatre landlords to abate and defer rents, raising $500 million of new public debt in April and developing new health and cleaning protocols with the best global experts to keep our theatres safe,\u201d Chief Executive Adam Aron said.\n\n\u2022 Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. US:BBBY has appointed Neil Lick to the senior vice president of owned brands role, leading a new team that will start launching private labels in 2021 for the home retailer. Lick previously spent 22 years with Williams-Sonoma Inc. US:WSM where he held a number of roles, including head of corporate social responsibility.

Andrew Cuomo on Monday outlined the metrics that will determine whether schools can welcome students back to the classroom in September, although the final decision will not be made until next month. He also issued new orders for out-of-state travelers as coronavirus cases continue to surge nationwide.\n\nThe state\u2019s plan to get students back in class includes both a formula for regions to determine if it is safe to consider reopening, plus guidelines for how that school will do so. A final decision about which schools will get a green light to open will be made the first week of August, according to Cuomo.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to reopen the schools,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not, do we reopen or not? You reopen when it is safe to reopen...we\u2019re not going to put our children in a place where their health is endangered.\u201d\n\nThe statewide formula is driven by data, Cuomo explained. Schools will reopen if that region is in Phase 4 (all regions are currently in Phase 4 except for New York City) and the daily infection rate remains at 5% as of the first week of August or lower over a 14-day average.\n\nThe current statewide infection rate is below 2% in most of New York, according to state data.\n\nHowever, should a spike occur between the announcement and the start of school, the state does have a \u201csafety valve.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchools will close if the regional infection rate is above 9% on a seven-day average,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s purely on the numbers.\u201d\n\nThe New York State Department of Education also issued guidelines for reopening on Monday. These include testing and screening, social distancing mandates, a framework for in-person and remote learning and other education guidelines.\n\nHowever, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last week that New York City schools will reopen in a limited way in September.

There were 792 new hospitalizations, the lowest since March 18, according to Cuomo. Ten people died on Sunday of the virus. More than 400,000 cases have been reported in the state, and close to 25,000 fatalities. On Saturday, New York City reported no deaths for the first time since March.\n\nBut concerns remain about travelers from states that have seen recent peaks in positive COVID-19 patients\u2014such as Florida, Arizona and Texas\u2014spreading the virus in New York.\n\nThe state has already instituted a mandatory 14-day quarantine for these travelers, but non-compliance has led to outbreaks, the governor said. He pointed to rising cases in upstate Rensselaer County, where someone visited from Georgia. About 2.5% of tests there came back positive for the virus as of Sunday, according to New York state data.\n\nTo combat a resurgence, Cuomo announced an emergency health order mandating that everyone flying into New York must provide information to airport officials about where they are coming from and where they are staying. Location forms will be available on the airplane or electronically.\n\n\u201cIf you leave the airport without providing the information, you will receive a summons immediately with a $2,000 fine,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou can then be brought to a hearing in order to complete mandatory quarantine.\u201d\n\nThe mandate will be carried out at all New York state airports.

The cuts were then extended to the end of July. The Saudi proposal would see the alliance, known as OPEC+, relax its curbs by 2 million barrels a day to 7.7 million barrels beginning in August, the WSJ report said.\n\nAnalysts played down the overall implications of a move to ease curbs.\n\n\u201cIf the group decides to ease cuts from the 1 August, this should not lead to a change in views on the market, with most assuming that OPEC+ would start easing cuts by this stage already,\u201d said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, in a note. \u201cHowever continuing deeper cuts would be more of a surprise.\n\nBut some analysts argued that the potential for oil to see renewed pressure, particularly as the number of coronavirus cases shows a renewed rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, could make some producers reluctant to ease curbs next month.\n\n\u201cOPEC+ could justify the designated increase in production as of now, but if the virus continues to surge globally over the next week, the demand forecast will change, and the oil market could swing heavily back into oversupply territory,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a note.\n\nBack on Nymex, prices for petroleum products also declined, with August gasoline RBQ20, -2.29% down 0.8% at $1.2734 a gallon and August heating oil HOQ20, -1.91% losing 1.4% to $1.2235 a gallon."}]}}}
