Councils fear the data will be used to enforce more local lockdowns of the kind imposed in Leicester, where all but essential shops must stay shut, schoolchildren have been sent home, and pubs and restaurants remain closed.\n\nThe top 10 ranking is likely to be based on a document circulated to local health chiefs on Thursday, headed \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d. The chart, compiled by PHE and reproduced here, ranks the 20 councils with the highest proportion of positive cases. Leicester remains at its head, with 5.7% of individuals who underwent a test found to have the virus. Kirklees, in West Yorkshire, was not far behind, with a 5% rate. Bradford, and Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, were the next highest.\n\nTitled \u201clocal authority areas of interest\u201d, the table is based on testing between 21 June and 4 July. It identifies six areas of \u201cconcern\u201d. More serious cases are labelled as needing \u201cenhanced support\u201d, with three councils in this category. One \u2013 Leicester \u2013 is listed as requiring \u201cintervention\u201d.\n\nThe document states \u201cthese areas are currently under investigation by the local public health protection teams\u201d. \u201cTesting access is being increased in areas including Bradford\u201d, it says, and the areas listed are \u201cassociated with workplace outbreaks which have contributed to the increase in infection rates\u201d.\n\nLast month, 164 workers at a meat factory in Kirklees tested positive, and at the beginning of July, a bed factory in Batley, which is administered by Kirklees Council, was closed after eight workers were found to have the virus.The communities most affected have several factors in common: poverty, poor health and a high proportion of non-white residents.\n\nThe top 10 is likely to change daily, although some areas will remain severely affected for weeks, health directors believe.\n\n\u201cThose on the list are going to be characterised by higher deprivation, higher black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities and denser housing,\u201d said a public health director briefed on the plans.\n\n\u201cSome are going to be in the list for the whole period of the pandemic. The drivers are structural and demographic, so the pattern of spread will reflect the inequalities that already existed. Some of the most strapped-for-cash councils are going to be dealing with some of the worst outbreaks.\u201d\n\nAreas with large south Asian populations, particularly where several generations may share a home and live in crowded conditions, are among those emerging as particularly at risk.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hand sanitiser at Kober meat processing plant in Cleckheaton, confirmed as the location of a localised coronavirus outbreak. Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA\n\nBradford has the highest proportion of people of Pakistani origin in England.\n\nThe council has today deployed testing units, staffed by the armed forces, to its Bowling and Keighley districts. Residents will be able to be tested without an appointment. Similar units will be deployed in Blackburn and Sheffield.\n\n\u201cBradford has a higher infection rate than most but it\u2019s coming down due to action we\u2019ve taken,\u201d said council leader Susan Hinchcliffe. \u201cWe welcome the dialogue with government. We\u2019re already doing more testing than any other authority in the region, but want to do more.\u201d\n\nBradford has asked for its own mobile testing units, more environmental health officers, support to pay full wages to low-paid workers having to self-isolate, and funding to develop its own local test-and-trace system.\n\nOfficials have not yet outlined what metrics will be used to impose further lockdowns, but it is understood a system based on the German model is under discussion. This would involve a threshold of 50 weekly positive tests per 100,000 of the population in any given council. Once that is breached, special measures could be triggered.\n\nData made public on Thursday shows Leicester is currently on 116 new cases per 100,000 of population per week, down from 140 two weeks ago.\n\nRochdale is in second place, with nearly 33 cases, down from over 50 three weeks ago. Kirklees is also suffering high rates, as are Bradford, Blackburn with Darwen, Rotherham and Bedford.\n\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the UK\u2019s first local lockdown on 29 June as Leicester reported 944 new cases in a fortnight. Non-essential shops and schools were shut, and pubs and restaurants were unable to reopen. Legislation to enforce the restrictions was pushed through parliament.\n\nDesperate to avoid Leicester\u2019s fate, councils are lobbying for a \u201cgraded response\u201d, the local public health director said, with a rolling back of some elements of lockdown, such as larger gatherings, rather than closure of whole sectors. \u201cWhat we want to avoid is the secretary of state making clumsy, unhelpful interventions, so we are getting ahead of the curve, understanding what our problem is and acting to address it. But we are hampered by slow reporting of data and absence of data,\u201d they added.\n\nCouncils have only just begun to receive a breakdown of new cases by postcode, and this is arriving weekly. Health chiefs say they need the information daily if they are to spot outbreaks in time to stop them spreading.\n\nThe plans to publish a top 10 were discussed on a regional call with Public Health England, two public health directors confirmed. \u201cThey seem to be intent on putting it into the public domain,\u201d said one of those on the call. \u201cWe have expressed some concerns over how they do it, as the data does need to be interpreted. Nonetheless, I welcome transparency.\u201d\n\nThe classified list of 20 at-risk councils uses six metrics including number of cases per 100,000 of population per week and per day, percentage of individuals testing positive as a proportion of all tests, and \u201cexceedances\u201d. This is where councils are issued with a red light because they consistently have more positive cases than forecast by a government algorithm. A slightly lower number of exceedances leads to an amber light.\n\nThe chart also shows the number of community outbreaks per council over the last week. Outbreaks are classed as two or more positive tests in a single setting, such as a workplace, school or prison.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said it did not have a set trigger, but would use a range of data to decide where and how to act, stating: \u201cWe have been transparent about our response to coronavirus and are always looking to improve the data we publish, including the way we update testing statistics.\n\n\u201cThe list of the 10 local authorities with the highest weekly incidence of coronavirus is already publicly available in PHE\u2019s weekly surveillance report.\n\n\u201cAll councils in England now have the ability to access testing data, right down to an individual and postcode level. If councils feel they require more assistance with data, of course, PHE is able to help them.\u201d\n\nKirklees and Sheffield councils were approached for comment."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/11/roger-stone-donald-trump-commutation-outrage", "published": "2020-07-11T17:23:23", "title": "Trump's commutation of ally Roger Stone's sentence sparks outrage", "text": "Outrage is growing among opponents of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to commute the prison sentence of his longtime friend and notorious Republican fixer Roger Stone despite the US attorney general having declared Stone\u2019s conviction \u201crighteous\u201d.\n\nCriticism on Saturday came from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nAdam Schiff, a California Democrat and chairmen of the House intelligence committee \u2013 the congressional panel Stone was convicted of lying to about aspects of the Trump-Russia investigation \u2013 called the decision \u201cdestructive of the criminal justice system and the rule of law\u201d on Saturday morning.\n\nSenator Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, described the decision as \u201cunprecedented, historic corruption\u201d.\n\nMitt Romney (@MittRomney) Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president.\n\nTrump commuted the sentence of Stone on Friday night.

The South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally these days, has said the commutation was justified.\n\nKyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) Romney is likely to be the only GOP lawmaker to express any version of this sentiment.

A low-calibre Glock handgun bought for \u00a3135 in eastern Europe could be converted in just 90 seconds to a 9mm weapon that could be sold for up to \u00a35,000.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The korpion Vz61, A Czech 7.65 mm submachine gun. Photograph: Military Images/Alamy Stock Photo\n\n\u201cThe mark-up is quite staggering. Liverpool, the north-west, is so active in this area,\u201d said Perfect. Hickinbottom said that north-west-based \u201cresellers\u201d were importing \u00a33.50 plastic switches from China that could swiftly convert a Glock into an automatic firearm.\n\nLast week, police raids in Liverpool included raids on individuals suspected of importing guns, ammunition and firearm components.\n\nAnalysis of the intelligence from EncroChat has revealed other surprises to firearms officers. Perfect said: \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me before Venetic what was the firearm of choice for an organised crime group, I\u2019d have absolutely said the Glock handgun. Venetic showed that the \u0160korpion SMG and the Grand Power are now becoming that weapon of choice.\u201d\n\nLiverpool\u2019s top-tier gangs have successfully utilised the city\u2019s geography \u2013 the secret EncroChat messages confirm that they source cocaine direct from South American cartels via the city\u2019s vast container port.\n\n\u201cOperation Venetic has definitely identified that link between high-end drugs-supply, drugs coming in from South America. We\u2019re not talking about county lines, this is high-end drugs coming into the country in significant amounts,\u201d said Hickinbottom.\n\nRelationships have also been forged with serious organised-crime groups across the Irish Sea.\n\n\u201cIf you are at the top end of serious organised crime you have that reach into Ireland, good connections to Scotland, the gun capital of Manchester. Probably the only place that isolates you is the London market,\u201d said Perfect.\n\nHe also pointed to the historical \u201ccredibility\u201d of Liverpool\u2019s organised-crime groups and figures such as Curtis Warren, 57, from Toxteth, who was once Interpol\u2019s Target One and is thought to have made \u00a3300m from drug-smuggling during the 1990s.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Curtis Warren is thought to have made \u00a3300m from drug-smuggling during the 1990s. Photograph: States of Jersey Police/PA\n\n\u201cIn Liverpool and the north-west there is a combination of really good business entrepreneurs that have evolved from the days of Curtis Warren, learnt new mechanisms, means of communication, transport, and concealment,\u201d said Perfect.\n\nThis criminal skillset, he, should be considered alongside the city\u2019s demographics. Research released before the pandemic showed that a third of children across the Liverpool City region lived below the poverty line.\n\n\u201cYou look at the consistent demographic of unemployment and deprived areas and how serious organised crime has evolved. If you did an assessment on how society has evolved with serious organised crime, Liverpool\u2019s gangs have probably been at the forefront,\u201d said Perfect.\n\nBut the kingpins of Merseyside\u2019s criminal syndicates have largely fled the city, electing to direct large-scale importation of firearms and drugs from overseas, most often from Holland, Dubai and the south of Spain. Analysis from Operation Venetic has also showed that some directed hitmen to execute rivals from their overseas bases. In some cases military grenades were left in the gardens of targets.\n\nBeing abroad also offers the advantage of face-to-face networking with other international criminals.\n\n\u201cThese locations operate like the Wall Street of criminality. Your highest-end members have to be present and carry that level of credibility; you\u2019re not going to be doing that from Liverpool.\n\n\u201cYou might want access to South Americans, access to Dutch hauliers for logistics, access to customers back in the UK. It\u2019s about sculpting your business model,\u201d said Perfect."}]}, "breitbart": {"link": "http://www.breitbart.com/", "articles": [{"title": "Exclusive \u2014 Mike Pence: 2020 a Choice Between \u2018Leadership' and 'the Left'", "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News exclusively on Thursday that the \u201cstakes have never been higher\u201d than the 2020 presidential election in a choice between \u201cleadership\u201d from President Donald Trump and the radical \u201cleft\u201d from former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cI think the stakes have never been higher, and the choice has never been clearer,\u201d Pence said in the exclusive interview on Thursday on his and Trump\u2019s campaign bus. \u201cIn President Donald Trump, you have a leader who\u2019s delivered on every promise that he made to the people of America\u2014to rebuild our military, to revive our economy, to appoint conservatives to our courts at every level\u2014and has seen our nation through one of the greatest health challenges in the past 100 years. In Joe Biden, you have a candidate that\u2019s being driven by the radical left calling for more taxes, more regulation, and advocating the kind of policies that will literally trample on the Second Amendment rights and values. The Supreme Court decision yesterday on the Little Sisters of the Poor finally set right what was wrong in the Obama-Biden administration that sought to trample on religious freedom. This president took executive action to stand for religious liberty and the Supreme Court, and both decisions affirmed our commitment to our highest ideal.\u201d\n\nPence continued by noting that the choice American voters have in November is clear, one \u201cbetween leadership and the left.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I think it\u2019s about that, but it\u2019s a real choice as well between leadership and the left,\u201d Pence said. \u201cIn President Donald Trump, you have leadership that\u2019s been advancing an agenda that\u2019s made America stronger than ever before, has been willing to defend America at home and abroad, willing to stand with law enforcement without apology, and freed up the American economy through less taxes and less regulation, more American energy, and free and fair trade. He stood on the values and ideals enshrined in our Bill of Rights and the right to life.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, \u201cIn Joe Biden, you have someone who presided over a time of cutbacks in our military, opposed the military strike against Osama bin Laden, who\u2019s already advocating an agenda to raise taxes, advanced the policies of the Green New Deal, and has trampled on the American energy renaissance that\u2019s underway and [wants to] return to the economic surrender to China and other nations that was emblematic of the last administration.\u201d\n\nPence, too, noted that the current debate regarding police in the United States\u2014where Democrats have sought to defund police departments, and Trump and Republicans have stood up for law enforcement\u2014is a clearcut example of where the contrast between Trump\u2019s leadership and Biden\u2019s kowtowing to the left is on display. Pence\u2019s interview came just hours before he appeared at a Fraternal Order of Police lodge event in Philadelphia for a \u201cBack the Blue\u201d rally with police officers.\n\n\u201cI also think the choice between leadership and the left is emblematic when you look at this president\u2019s approach to law and order and his stand for law enforcement,\u201d Pence said. \u201cJoe Biden, who yesterday actually used the word \u2018enemy\u2019 to describe men and women in law enforcement, said he\u2019d be willing to cut funding for law enforcement. We\u2019re not going to defund the police. We\u2019re going to stand by the men and women of law enforcement, and we\u2019re going to fund better public safety in this country, which is what the American people want to happen. The whole range of issues, to me, really is a choice between American leadership and the far left. And it\u2019s why I\u2019m confident the American people are going to choose American leadership and four more years of President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nPence also made clear in the interview, as Breitbart News previously reported, that the \u201conly thing\u201d that stands between Americans and the radical \u201cfar left\u201d policies of the Democrat Party is a second term for President Trump. Earlier in the week, before this interview, Biden rolled out a \u201cunity\u201d plan with socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, where Biden actually lifted several passages straight from Sanders\u2019 socialist agenda word-for-word, adopting them as his own now. Asked about this, and if this proves that radical left element now controls Biden, Pence said this platform document is proof that Biden is not a moderate like he claims to be, but just as far left as the socialists ascendant within the Democrat Party.\n\n\u201cMy first look at their so-called \u2018unity platform\u2019 is it looks like Joe Biden has fully united with the American left,\u201d Pence said. \u201cThe American people see through it. You look at a whole range of policies where he\u2019s abandoned positions he took in the past. It just tells you that this election is not just about a choice between President Trump and Joe Biden; it\u2019s really a choice between an agenda that made America great again and poured a foundation that\u2019s seen our nation through one of the most challenging times in my lifetime and an agenda that would try to remake America along some European-style welfare state abandoning our ideals, abandoning our history, and abandoning our values.\u201d\n\nPence also, as Breitbart News has reported, highlighted the fact that Sanders is now effusively praising Biden, claiming he would be the most progressive leftist president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2014even more leftist than Barack Obama was when Biden served as his vice president.\n\n\u201cI just saw where Bernie Sanders said that Joe Biden could be the most progressive president since FDR,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWhen you have the enthusiasm of a socialist who ran for president, when you have the enthusiastic support of people who want to crush this economy with more taxes and more regulation\u2026I think this is a freedom-loving country, and the American people are going to choose freedom on November 3 when they vote to reelect President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe full interview with Pence aired on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel on Saturday morning.\n\nLISTEN TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/07/11/mike-pence-2020-election-choice-leadership-donald-trump-left-joe-biden/", "published": "2020-07-11T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Exclusive \u2014 Pence on Trade, China, Immigration: Trump Puts U.S. First", "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News exclusively that President Donald Trump has delivered on a number of promises he made to the American people to put \u201cAmerica First,\u201d especially on trade, China, and immigration.\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s meeting the day before this Thursday interview with Breitbart News aboard his and Trump\u2019s campaign bus in Pennsylvania with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2014in particular about the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\u2014Pence said Trump delivered on his promise to American workers.\n\n\u201cThe USMCA is a huge win for American jobs and American farmers,\u201d Pence said. \u201cIt\u2019s one more example of promises made, promises kept. I saw the president drive a hard bargain. I just left; I visited a dairy farm here in rural Pennsylvania, and dairy farmers were struggling in Wisconsin with the unfair trade practices coming out of Canada. I saw the president on that issue, on manufacturing, on automotive workers. He just stood strong, and putting American workers and manufacturers first and delivered a great victory that\u2019s, that combined with the strong stand he\u2019s taken on China, I think, show the American people that they really do have a president who will always put America first.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2014the presumptive 2020 Democrat presidential nominee\u2014has attempted to claim that President Trump is weak on China. In recent months, Biden\u2019s campaign has tried to claim that Trump has not been forceful or effective enough when it comes to standing up to the communist regime in Beijing. Pence debunked that when asked by Breitbart News to detail many of the things that President Trump has done to hold communist China accountable during his three-plus years in the White House now.\n\n\u201cWhen we took office, China was half of our international trade deficit,\u201d Pence said. \u201cPresident Trump made it clear that those days are over. We put China on notice that we were no longer going to tolerate trade policies and practices that have seen American jobs shipped overseas. So he\u2019s used his authority and imposed tariffs and taken a strong stand. We\u2019ve also, on strategic issues, we\u2019ve made it clear we\u2019re going to stand up for the interests of America in the Asia-Pacific. We\u2019ve defended the freedom of navigation. In fact, we have two aircraft carriers in the South China Sea taking a strong stand. Also, just more recently with China breaking their word on Hong Kong, and the president has announced we are taking action that will be out in the coming days that will demonstrate our commitment to the people of Hong Kong and our commitment to freedom-loving people around the world. But that, whether it be the strong stand on trade and tariffs, whether it be our commitment to our strategic interests in the region, or whether it be our stand for freedom and human rights, no president in my lifetime has been tougher on China than President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThen when it comes to immigration, Pence said President Trump\u2019s orders amid the coronavirus pandemic, in particular the ones halting new immigration and the ones stopping guest worker programs like the H-1B program mean that as the jobs come back and the economy recovers, the jobs go to Americans first.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping the American comeback,\u201d Pence said when asked about the president\u2019s myriad immigration orders during the pandemic. \u201cWhen the president stood up the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we had one mission, and that was to save lives. Now our mission going forward is to save lives and open up America again. But efforts the president took to protect American jobs throughout this pandemic, whether it be the Paycheck Protection Program or support for families or resources for businesses, was historic. But the action he also took to make sure that when the jobs come back, the jobs are going to Americans also played a critical role in the fact that at the height of the pandemic, we lost 22 million American jobs, and now in a few short months, we\u2019ve added seven million jobs back to the economy. We have a ways to go, but the president\u2019s action in every respect has been to make sure that American families and American businesses can see their way through this pandemic, and as the jobs come back, those jobs go to Americans first.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s full interview with Breitbart News aired on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel.

Mo Brooks (R-AL), who learned about the email from recipients. He has called the graphic a clear violation of the Hatch Act, which bans federal employees and members of the military from engaging in political activity at work.\n\nAfter Brooks revealed the email\u2019s existence on July 8, 2020, the Army issued a statement that said the \u201cProject Inclusion listening tour handout included two unapproved pages that were sent out in error and immediately recalled.\u201d\n\nThe Army statement said:\n\nThe slides \u2013 copied from a non-government website \u2013 included a word cloud with phrases that were intended to spark conversation; however, the document was predecisional and inappropriate for the discussion. The unapproved pages were in no way used as part of the \u201cYour Voice Matters\u201d listening tour sessions. As soon Department of the Army leaders were made aware of these products the Army initiated a 15-6 investigation to determine how this happened. The Army does not condone the use of phrases that indicate political support. The Army is and will continue to remain an apolitical organization.\n\nThe Army\u2019s statement did not specify which other page was sent in error.\n\nBrooks said in an interview with Breitbart News on Friday that he spoke to Army Under Secretary Jim McPherson but was not given any explanation for what happened.\n\n\u201cHe is going to order a 15-6 investigation, and a colonel is going to head up the investigation, and he expects it to be thorough, and once they have the information of who did what when where and why, then they\u2019ll be in a position to ascertain how best to handle this matter,\u201d Brooks said.\n\n\u201cIt would be fair to say that Under Secretary of the Army Jim McPherson, who I spoke with, was appalled at the email\u2019s content,\u201d he added.\n\nBrooks said he has not spoken to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, who launched Project Inclusion, which \u201cOperation Inclusion\u201d is apparently a part of.\n\nBrooks said the \u201cfirst step\u201d of the 15-6 investigation will include forensic examination of computers, use of email addresses, and the interview of witnesses.\n\n\u201cAppropriate culprits can then be dealt with appropriately.

Hundreds of local followers began showing up at his house. A developer turned him into a video game. The hashtag #ChickenLegPiece racked up almost 4 billion views on TikTok, with thousands of fans re-creating his style.\n\nThat stopped abruptly at the end of June. Following a deadly border clash with China in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, the Indian government banned over 50 Chinese mobile applications, including TikTok. The ban hit hard not just for millions of \u00adTikTok-obsessed Indian teenagers but also for the app\u2019s superstars, many of whom relied on it for an income. Now, they must find a new platform, a void that other social media platforms are scrambling to fill. This week, Instagram launched Reels, a video-sharing feature in India.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow TikTok could face a similar ban in the United States as tensions with China grow. President Trump has often blamed China for the worsening situation of the novel coronavirus in the United States and has barred U.S. companies from doing business with Chinese technology company Huawei. This week, Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States is considering banning some Chinese apps.\n\nOwned by the Chinese business ByteDance, TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times worldwide. Its biggest star is an American teenager from Connecticut. More than 40 percent of its users are under 24.\n\nTikTok\u2019s rise in India has been fueled in part by millions of first-time Internet users. At the beginning of the decade, an estimated 20 million people in the country had access to the Internet. In 2018, that figure had swelled to 560 million. India is also the second-largest smartphone market in the world and has the cheapest data prices. With 200 million users on TikTok, \u00adIndia was its biggest market outside of China.\n\nThe app became a symbol of the aspirations of the country\u2019s fast-growing young population. Millions of users from small-town India logged in to channel their creative fantasies, no matter how absurd. More important, it provided them quick fame and money \u2014 a rare prize in the country of more than 1.3 billion people.\n\nThe father of two teenagers, Kamathe was confounded by his success. For more than a year, he had danced and sung songs on the app without registering a blip. His big moment came after he began filming and describing his meals. Offers poured in from hotels to feature them, and colleges invited him to festivals. TikTok contacted him and told him he had set a niche trend, encouraging him to continue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI felt like a film star,\u201d he said. Unlike many other TikTokers, Kamathe \u2014 who sports tattoos and a biker mustache \u2014 was not dependent on the app to generate an income.\n\nBut the ban on the app has disrupted the dreams of stardom of many TikTok stars like Kamathe. In the days since, they have shifted to using similar, knockoff apps in a bid to retain or build on their popularity. But it\u2019s not easy.\n\n\u201cTikTok fame cannot be re-created easily,\u201d Kamathe said. \u201cNo one has heard of the other apps. TikTok is global.\u201d\n\nKamathe has tried his hand at Instagram and has used a live-streaming app to chat with fans. But he doesn\u2019t feel the same enthusiasm.\n\nHis foreign fans, too, are feeling his absence. Dozens of messages pour in daily on Instagram, he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI miss his videos a lot,\u201d said Joshua Ford, 16, from Columbus, Ohio, a TikToker who created videos in which he watches Kamathe eat. \u201cHe was my favorite because he could always put a smile on my face.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOgochukwu Akamelu, a Los Angeles-based founder of an influencer marketing group, described Kamathe as \u201cTikTok\u2019s greatest trend.\u201d The 22-year-old said he found the content \u201csimple, wholesome and hilarious.\u201d\n\nThe Indian government justified the ban saying it had received complaints that the banned apps were \u201cstealing\u201d user data in an \u201cunauthorized manner.\u201d This, they said, posed a threat to the \u201csovereignty and integrity\u201d of the country.\n\nIn a statement, TikTok India said it complies with \u201call data privacy and security requirements under Indian law.\u201d In an email to The Washington Post on Tuesday in response to Pompeo\u2019s statement, a TikTok spokesperson denied accusations of providing data to the Chinese government, pointing out that the company was led by an American CEO.\n\nAD\n\nKamathe said he feels compelled to stand in support of the government\u2019s decision. After weeks of tension and a troop buildup, both India and China say that they are in the process of disengaging from certain contentious points on the border but that talks are still ongoing.\n\nAD\n\nKamathe hopes the ban will be revoked soon as relations improve. For now, eating chicken leg pieces feels different.\n\n\u201cEarlier, I could share meals with millions,\u201d he said. \u201cSuddenly, I feel alone.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ukraine-central-bank-scandal-imf/2020/07/10/9a9eeba8-c04e-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-07-11T11:00:00", "title": "Ukraine\u2019s bank chief quit and received a coffin as a warning.

Giuliani, to dig up dirt in Ukraine on presumptive Democrat nominee Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nLeaks of confidential conversations involving Biden and former Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko \u2014 including a fresh batch made public Wednesday \u2014 have provided no major ammunition for Trump\u2019s campaign.

In June, a critical $2.1 billion in IMF loans landed, but the conditions included an independent central bank, a floating exchange rate and continuing inflation targeting.\n\nAD\n\nOther IMF prerequisites included the passage of a bill in May to prevent Kolomoisky from regaining control of PrivatBank.\n\n\u201cIf they try to cheat the IMF, the IMF should react in line with common sense,\u201d Gontareva said in an interview from London, citing apparent breaches of IMF conditions.\n\nAnother coffin warning\n\nGontareva fled to Britain in 2017 after her house was vandalized and masked men with Kalashnikov rifles delivered a coffin with her blood-soaked effigy to the National Bank of Ukraine, or NBU.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, masked men with machine guns searched her Kyiv apartment and her home outside Kyiv was burned to the ground.\n\nUkraine\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), has ominously warned former bank officials against commenting on the bank\u2019s operations \u2014 a directive analysts said appeared aimed at Gontareva, Smolii and other NBU bank officials.\n\nAD\n\nGontareva described the SBU as \u201cthis Ukrainian KGB.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not even experienced something like that in Soviet times,\u201d she said.\n\nWarning bells began sounding March 4, when Zelensky abruptly fired the reformist prime minister, Oleksiy Honcharuk, and his government. Next, general prosecutor Ruslan Ryaboshapka was ousted after engineering an ambitious overhaul of the prosecution service seeking to weed out corruption.\n\nCentral bank chief Smolii says he was forced out in a meeting with Zelensky on June 30. He said political interference had made it impossible to do his job.\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, Zelensky called for an 11 percent devaluation of Ukraine\u2019s currency, the hryvnia.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand [Zelensky] pretends that he supports central bank independence, and on the other hand he immediately undermines all our reforms, because an independent central bank is not just a slogan,\u201d Gontareva said.\n\nAD\n\nBefore fleeing Ukraine, Gontareva closed dozens of banks and nationalized PrivatBank, the country\u2019s biggest lender, in 2016 after $5.5 billion in deposits went missing.\n\nIt made her an enemy of the bank\u2019s former part owner, Kolomoisky, who is reportedly under investigation by the FBI for money laundering.\n\nShe believes he is behind the intimidation campaign against Smolii and the NBU.\n\n'Reform seems to be dead'\n\n\u201cThe nuthouse is calling for Gontareva,\u201d Kolomoisky told The Washington Post in a text message Friday.\n\nAD\n\nThe tycoon, who had a past business association with Zelensky, has previously denied Gontareva\u2019s accusations that he instigated the intimidation against her. Lawmakers recently passed a law preventing him from regaining control of PrivatBank.\n\nZelensky\u2019s office said he supported the NBU\u2019s independence, in emailed answers to questions, adding the new NBU chief would be an experienced professional with a good reputation.\n\nAD\n\nAnswering concerns that Kolomoisky had long sought Smolii\u2019s departure, the office said the tycoon had no influence over state institutions.\n\n\u201cSmolii\u2019s resignation was a surprise to the president\u2019s office. No one expected or demanded his replacement,\u201d the office said. \u201cThe Office of the President cannot force a person to remain in office if he or she does not want to.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSmolii\u2019s version is different. He said it became clear at the June 30 meeting that Zelensky wanted him out. He asked Zelensky if he wanted him to go and the president said yes, Smolii said.\n\nGoesta Ljungman, head of IMF\u2019s office in Ukraine, said \u201cthe fact that the management of the NBU openly says that it is subject to political pressure should be of concern to all,\u201d speaking to Ukrainian business news website Liga.net.\n\n\u201cReform seems to be dead in Ukraine,\u201d the analyst Ash added. \u201cThe obvious concern now is that we see a return to the disastrous economic policies run under former Ukraine president [Viktor] Yanukovych,\u201d he said referring to a pro-Russian Ukraine leader forced from office in the 2014 Revolution of Dignity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe timing of Smolii\u2019s acrimonious departure was also a blow: less than three weeks later, Zelensky signed a memorandum agreeing to IMF conditions to allow money to flow.\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d said Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, \u201chis word means nothing.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/bahrain-found-evidence-of-torture-behind-confession-but-death-sentences-still-stand/2020/07/10/b6b04a66-c211-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-07-11T11:00:00", "title": "Bahrain found evidence of torture behind confession.

My death will be unlawful, and yet, it has been [ordained] by law.\u201d\n\nRamadan, 37, and his friend Hussain Moosa, 34, were sentenced in 2014 to death, and Bahrain\u2019s highest court upheld the capital punishment a year later.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which is part of the public prosecutor\u2019s office, uncovered a previously undisclosed medical report by a government doctor saying Moosa had injuries that matched his allegations of torture. Citing the doctor\u2019s findings of injuries on Moosa\u2019s wrists, the SIU concluded there was evidence of torture.\n\nIn a memo opening the 573-page document, which was reviewed by The Washington Post, the SIU said that if the court had known of the nature and timing of the injuries, it might have had rendered a different ruling.\n\nThe watchdog agency had reviewed the case as part of its mandate to investigate criminal allegations against security forces for torture or mistreatment of prisoners.\n\nAD\n\nMoosa and Ramadan are Shiite Muslims who participated in pro-democracy protests that engulfed Bahrain in 2011 during the Arab Spring demonstrations after facing years of discrimination by the Sunni-controlled government.\n\nAD\n\nBoth men said they have been tortured and sexually assaulted. Moosa told the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) that he had confessed under torture, incriminating Ramadan as well.\n\nAfter the SIU released its findings and urged that the death sentences be revoked, the Court of Cessation, which had issued them, threw out its earlier ruling.\n\nBut the separate High Criminal Court of Appeal reissued the death sentences in January. The public prosecutor said the court reinstated the sentences after finding that the convictions were not based on the defendants\u2019 statements. The court also rejected the conclusion that Moosa\u2019s confession occurred because of torture and cited evidence that he had not been abused, according to a legal document obtained by BIRD.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe court effectively rewrote the government\u2019s own evidence to discount Moosa's torture,\u201d Human Rights Watch said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nA Bahraini government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about the case.\n\n\u201cThis trial exemplifies the injustice faced by dissidents in Bahrain, where opposing the government is punished with torture, judicial harassment and even death,\u201d said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, advocacy director at BIRD. \u201cBahrain\u2019s Western allies have long turned a blind eye to these abuses, and the time has come for them to take a stand.\u201d\n\nThe SIU had conducted its investigation after Bahrain came under pressure from Britain\u2019s Foreign Office for not responding to complaints submitted by Ramadan\u2019s wife and a U.S.-based human rights group, both claiming he had been tortured. Bahrain initially denied receiving a complaint, but an advocacy group, Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain, produced a receipt, showing the complaint had been submitted. Bahrain then referred the case to the SIU.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFamily members said they had noticed the effect of torture soon after the men\u2019s arrests.\n\n\u201cI saw the torture marks on his wrist. His hand was bloated,\u201d said Zahra, Moosa\u2019s younger sister, in an interview. She said she saw him a week after his arrest. \u201cI got psychologically exhausted looking at him.\u201d\n\nFor the past few years, Zahra said, Moosa has described torture, including how his genitalia were so badly abused that he\u2019d involuntarily urinate.\n\nWhen Ramadan\u2019s wife, Zeinab, first saw him in detention, 10 days after his arrest, she found herself looking at a gaunt man who resembled her husband. \u201cWhen I hugged him, I tried to press him close, and I felt his body flinch,\u201d she recalled.\n\nAD\n\nBoth Zahra and Zeinab said the two men do not expect their sentence will be overturned again. All four believe the men are likely to be executed.\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-confederate-flag-civil-war-americana-santa-barbara/2020/07/11/1e8a7c84-bec4-11ea-b4f6-cb39cd8940fb_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-07-11T09:11:55", "title": "They lost the Civil War and fled to Brazil. Their descendants refuse to take down the Confederate flag.", "text": "It\u2019s one of history\u2019s lesser-known episodes. After the Civil War, thousands of defeated Southerners came to Brazil to self-exile in a country that still practiced slavery. For decades, their descendants have thrown a massive party that now attracts thousands of people to the twin cities of Americana and Santa B\u00e1rbara d\u2019Oeste to celebrate all things Dixie. The Confederate flag? Everywhere.\n\nOn flagpoles and knickknacks. Emblazoned on the dance floor. Clutched by men clad in Confederate battle gray. Decorating the grounds of the cemetery that holds the remains of veterans of the rebel army \u2014 the immigrants known here as the confederados.\n\nIn a country that has long been more preoccupied with class divisions than racism, the Confederate symbols, stripped of their American context, never registered much notice. But now, as the racial reckoning in the United States following the death of George Floyd inspires a similar reexamination of values in Brazil, that has begun to change.\n\nBrazilians in recent weeks have demanded the removal of the notorious statue in S\u00e3o Paulo of a 17th-century settler who enslaved indigenous people. Protests for black equality have rumbled through several cities. And in Americana and Santa B\u00e1rbara d\u2019Oeste, the cities founded by the Confederates, Brazilians who have never been to the United States are increasingly asking questions piercingly familiar to Americans: Where should the Confederacy be remembered \u2014 on a flagpole, or in a museum?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy mind has been opened to the questions,\u201d said Colbachini, 35, whose middle name pays homage to Robert E. Lee. She attended the festival for most of her life, but has now stopped going. Despite worrying what her community might think, she has begun asking that the flag be taken down.\n\n\u201cIt represents my family\u2019s traditions,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the entire world, in the United States, they know what it also represents.\u201d\n\nThe debate has simmered for years. On one side is the Fraternity of American Descendants, the group that throws the annual party, tends to the Confederate cemetery grounds and promotes a Lost Cause orthodoxy reminiscent of the most ardent Confederacy apologists. On the other is the Black Union for Equality, which has been leading a community charge to strip the festival of the flag considered by many to be a symbol of hate and repression.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn what might be the furthest outpost of the American culture wars, a new battle over the Confederate flag is only just beginning.\n\nA mass exodus in search of land and slaves\n\nThe newspapers called it \u201cBrazilian fever.\u201d With the war lost, thousands of Southerners, fearful of living under Northern rule among freed slaves, were seeking other opportunities. Some pushed for Mexico. Others for Venezuela. But Brazil, which wouldn\u2019t abolish slavery for another 23 years, until 1888, proved to be the most attractive of countries.\n\nEmperor Dom Pedro II, a fierce advocate of the South during the war, tried to induce their immigration, offering free transport, cheap land and an easy path to citizenship. Before long, Southerners sailed out from New Orleans and Mobile, Ala., for Rio de Janeiro. Eventually, between 8,000 and 20,000 immigrated.\n\n\u201cMove here and buy land,\u201d Col. Charles Gunter urged in a letter to the Charleston Mercury newspaper in 1868. \u201cWe have here a beautiful place for our village, in the center of rich land, and on a grand river.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut historians say one of the central draws was a country where Southerners could freeze time and continue a lifestyle that had been put to a violent end in the United States. In journals, one bragged about how inexpensive Brazilian slaves were; another lamented that they couldn\u2019t bring recently-freed American slaves to Brazil.\n\n\u201cThey came to continue having slaves,\u201d said Luciana Brito, a historian at the Federal University of Bahia Reconc\u00e2vo. \u201cThey associated the existence of slavery in Brazil with the maintenance of a system of racial subservience.\u201d\n\nBrito and other historians have scoured letters, journal entries and deeds of sale. One researcher found that more than three-fourths of Southerners who wrote to the Brazilian government to inquire about immigration were slaveholders. At least 54 families bought at least 536 slaves upon entering Brazil. Using racial epithets, they expressed fears of an \u201cAfrican government\u201d in Brazil, and black \u201crulers\u201d in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe confederados presented themselves as refugees of a devastated America,\u201d said Jordan Brasher, a historian at Columbus State University who wrote his dissertation on the confederado communities. \u201cAs the downtrodden, poor, defeated Confederate soldiers looking to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.\n\n\u201cThey also brought the ideology of white supremacy and racial terrorism from the United States South to Brazil.\u201d\n\nIn one dark episode, two Confederate immigrants led a mob in the lynching of a police chief who had refused to track down escaped slaves \u2014 in front of his family. The confederados were also suspected of assassinating a Brazilian senator who supported emancipation.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1888, Brazil became the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery, nearly a quarter-century after the United States. But interracial relations in the two countries were different. There were neither the draconian racial distinctions in Brazil, nor government prohibitions on intermarrying between races. The races mixed, yielding a country of extraordinary diversity. Over time, some confederados adopted new opinions on race.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne of the changes most evidenced in the Confederados of my youth . . . was their belief in tolerance among the races,\u201d Eugene C. Harter, who was raised among the confederados, wrote in a book about the community. \u201cThis they had acquired from the Brazilians.\u201d\n\nThe confederados and their descendants assimilated and intermarried. English was largely forgotten. The towns become indistinguishable from their neighbors. One of the few elements to remain was the yearly Confederate party, with its pageantry, its music and its flag.\n\nAD\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want to be black\u2019\n\nCl\u00e1udia Monteiro, president of the local Black Union for Equality, rarely paid much attention to the party. She\u2019d spent 40 of her 48 years in Santa B\u00e1rbara d\u2019Oeste and, to her, it was nothing more than a town quirk. Living in Brazil, other racial issues had always seemed more pressing, including those in her own life.\n\nAD\n\nLike many Brazilians, she grew up identifying as morena, one of the many distinctions in the country\u2019s racial taxonomy, rather than the darker negra. Negra, she was led to believe in mass media, and even in her family, was \u201calways ugly. Their hair was ugly. Their form was ugly. I didn\u2019t want to be black.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNot until she saw the work of the photographer Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado did she reassess that belief. In his images, she said, she recognized so much beauty and dignity in the faces of Africa and Brazil that she committed herself to black history and activism.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, she and another activist got to talking about Dylann Roof. The killer of nine black churchgoers in Charleston had glorified the Confederate flag, and it was taken down from the South Carolina statehouse. But in Brazil, officials weren\u2019t asking for its removal from the Confederate extravaganza. They were actively supporting it, and had put the party on the official S\u00e3o Paulo events calendar.\n\nWith the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, their frustration only grew. \u201cWe started to mobilize,\u201d said Carlinhos Barros, the other activist.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the man whom they asked to remove the flag had a very different interpretation of it \u2014 an interpretation they learned in detail at a public debate. The sides agreed to the event in the hope of settling their differences. But before a crowd of dozens, they could scarcely agree on a shared syntax, much less a common set of facts.\n\nOne side said the Civil War was about slavery. The other side said the \u201cWar of Secession\u201d was about independence.\n\nOne said the flag was racist. The other side said it wasn\u2019t.\n\nOne side demanded it come down. The other demanded it stay.\n\n\u201cWe have to respect the history of the other, the pain of the other,\u201d pleaded Monteiro.\n\n\u201cThe flag will not come down,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Leopoldo Padoveze, president of the Fraternity of American Descendants.\n\nHe said there was no reason to be ashamed of the flag. It wasn\u2019t racist, and neither were the confederados who waved it. His great grandmother, and her mother before, had been black. People of color had frequently come to the party. So Padoveze put the Confederate flag on his car, in his office, on the hat he wore while giving speeches.\n\nAD\n\nHe wanted people to know the good his ancestors had accomplished in Brazil. They introduced farming equipment and techniques that helped to revolutionize Brazilian agriculture. They founded the first Protestant churches. They established schools all over S\u00e3o Paulo state. Brazil was better because the confederados settled here, he believed, and the flag was their symbol.\n\n\u201cThey are saying that I\u2019m racist, when I\u2019m not,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because I have a different view of this very complex thing.\u201d\n\nSo Padoveze refused to take it down, despite Monteiro\u2019s pleas. She responded by camping herself outside the party in protest. Last year, scores of people arrived, carrying large banners. \u201cLower the Confederate flag,\u201d they demanded.\n\nThe problem wasn\u2019t the party, Monteiro told the revelers. It was the flag. It had to go.\n\nPadoveze still refused.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve considered what they\u2019ve said, but I know the flag isn\u2019t what they say it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my view, and it\u2019s very personal.\u201d\n\nMonteiro has also refused to yield. Her group is planning to ask local lawmakers for help. They\u2019ve distributed letters of condemnation that have garnered the support of more than 100 religious and civil rights organizations. Younger generations, whose pleas for racial equality have intensified since George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis police custody, have taken up her calls.\n\nThis year\u2019s party, scheduled for April, was canceled amid Brazil\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, now the world\u2019s second worst. But both Monteiro and Padoveze know the flag will fly again in their community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the story of my family,\u201d Padoveze said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s racism,\u201d Monteiro said.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s right, and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d Padoveze asked."}]}, "marketwatch": {"rss": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/topstories/", "link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/investing?mod=breadcrumb", "articles": [{"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B761587AE-C1EA-11EA-9309-095339FF535B%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-07-11T21:34:18", "title": "5 ways to beat the stock market \u2014 from a fund manager who\u2019s done this for years", "text": "Wall Street is so full of greed, fraud and ego, a cynic might say it\u2019s no place for any kind of spirituality to find a home.\n\nBut several religious precepts might actually help investors if they paid them more mind, judging by the long-term returns of Amana Growth Fund AMIGX, +0.06% .\n\nThe fund avoids companies in activities prohibited by Islamic law. That brings the expected ban on alcohol, \u201csin\u201d and pork-processing companies. But it also layers in core investing principles that help this fund\u2019s long-term outperformance. You\u2019d probably be wise to follow these concepts \u2014 described below \u2014 whatever your religion.\n\nI also take a look at other principles you should adopt because they help explain this fund\u2019s record, according to Scott Klimo, now lead manager of the fund after co-managing it since 2012. The fund beats its Morningstar category (large-cap growth) by 1.3 to 1.8 percentage points annualized over the past three and five years, with less volatility to boot, according to Morningstar.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at investing concepts you can borrow from this fund to boost your returns and, who knows, get more peace of mind in the process.\n\n1. Avoid debt\n\nIslamic law prohibits paying or receiving interest, so banks are out. But this also contributes to the imposition of limits on company debt. Any businesses with a debt-to-market-cap ratio above 33% get the boot.\n\n\u201cWe believe that financial sustainability is integral to the success of a business,\u201d Klimo told me in a recent interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve done multiple studies, and it just works. It creates a nice tailwind, and this contributes to performance.\u201d\n\nA basic investing principle is at work here: The easiest way to make money is to not lose it. Heavily leveraged companies can blow up, so avoiding them reduces risk. \u201cRisk reduction goes hand in hand with performance,\u201d says Klimo.\n\nThis rule keeps the fund out of notoriously volatile areas like basic materials, real estate, telecom and banks. This means the fund bounces around less than the S&P 500 SPX, +1.04% , the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.43% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.66% . The Amana Growth Fund is one of the least-volatile funds in its category, says Morningstar analyst David Kathman.\n\n2. Stop watching every tick and overtrading\n\nSpend any time on Twitter and you\u2019ll notice how mesmerized people get watching the market and their stocks trade all day, commenting on every little move. This is pretty stupid, and a big waste of time. It doesn\u2019t make your stocks go up any faster. It drains energy by creating stress.\n\n\u201cPeople just bang their heads against the wall sometimes,\u201d says Klimo. \u201cSturm and drang doesn\u2019t really add value.\u201d\n\nThis is valuable advice, both for reducing stress, and for freeing up time for activities that actually help \u2014 like actual research.\n\nBecause Islamic law discourages speculation, excessive portfolio trading is out at the Amana Growth fund. It has a decidedly long-term approach. The average holding period is greater than 10 years. It has held Apple AAPL, +0.24% since maybe before you were born \u2014 the early 1990s.\n\nSo when COVID-19 hit the headlines in March, Klimo didn\u2019t scour holdings for names to ditch because they might fall more. \u201cWe said we own good companies and they will come out strong on the other side. So it will be fine,\u201d says Klimo.\n\nPart of this long-term doctrine means having the sense to stay in good names even if they look expensive. \u201cWe will hold if the operational thesis is still intact,\u201d says the fund manager.\n\nFor example, Amana Growth has a 6% position in Intuit INTU, -0.11% . That\u2019s a really big holding given that many mutual funds limit size of a single holding to 1%-2% of the overall portfolio. The tax and financial software company looks pricey with a forward P/E in the upper 30 range. Growth may get hit as COVID-19 puts customers out of business.\n\n\u201cBut they have a tremendous long-term double-digit earnings growth track record,\u201d says Klimo. \u201cWe still like the story long term.\u201d Near-term, Intuit would get a boost if Joe Biden becomes president in January, which would bring lots changes to federal tax laws, in turn supporting demand for its products.\n\nWhen does Klimo sell? Triggers include a change in the original investment thesis, or signs of management malfeasance.\n\n3. Invest in companies with a sustainable competitive advantage\n\nA favorite is companies with a clear technology edge. Klimo has a 4.7% position in ASML ASML, +0.33% ASML, +1.26% , which makes lithography machines that produce chips. ASML has a lock on the market with 75% share. As this business transitions to \u201cextreme ultraviolet lithography,\u201d which uses ultraviolet wavelengths in chip production, ASML will have 100% market share, predicts Klimo. \u201cThey will just own the market. They have a technological edge over everybody.\u201d\n\nAnother example: TJX TJX, +2.16% , a 2.8% position. Klimo thinks TJX, whose stores include T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, is so good at discount retailing and setting up the lure of the \u201ctreasure hunt,\u201d it has its own niche \u2014 and a protective moat that keeps competitors at bay. Now, with retailers going out of business because of the slowdown, TJX will be able to find even more bargains for shoppers, which will help results.\n\n4. Invest in high quality of management\n\nYou can spot them by looking at their track records. Klimo owns the home improvement retailer Lowe\u2019s LOW, +1.34% in part because Marvin Ellison took over as CEO in 2018, after years of producing great results at Home Depot HD, +0.86% . Now he\u2019s using many of the same tactics to boost profit margins at Lowe\u2019s \u2014 like fine-tuning inventory management and online operations.\n\nKlimo is also sticking with Apple because of the \u201ctremendous\u201d leadership of CEO Tim Cook. Klimo cites Apple\u2019s success with services. Popular offerings like Apple Pay, iTunes and the App Store, have thrived under Cook. Unlike skeptics, Klimo isn\u2019t worry Apple will stumble in smartphone innovation. He expects new 5G-capable models coming out in the fall to be a hit. \u201cWe still have supreme confidence in the investment thesis.\u201d\n\n5. Go with diversity at the top\n\nKlimo likes gender diversity in top management and boards because he says it improves company performance. Here, he cites holding Est\u00e9e Lauder EL, +1.00% , which has five women on its executive team including the CFO, and seven women among its 16 board members. Klimo expects continued growth through expansion in China and other parts of Asia. He also rejects the theory that working from home stifles cosmetics demand. \u201cPeople still want to look good on their Zoom calls.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s ahead for the economy\n\nKlimo also likes Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s history of holding up in a weak economy. That\u2019ll come in handy, because he doesn\u2019t expect a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery. He cites the continuing spread of COVID-19, which will worsen when flu season arrives. Even if governments don\u2019t impose broad lockdowns, companies will shut facilities and stores.\n\nSee the latest MarketWatch coronavirus coverage here.\n\nAnother risk few people are talking about: State governments\u2019 balanced-budget mandates. Shortfalls in tax revenue will bring large cuts in state services, a big part of the economy. \u201cThere is a real big problem coming down the pike from the perspective of state budgets.\u201d\n\nNot that any of this matters for Klimo\u2019s investment strategy. If history is any guide, his fund will just stick with its winners through any worsening of the economy.\n\nAt the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

My wife and I are both 57 and have been aggressive savers ever since my brother, an institutional retirement financial expert, told us to max out our savings when we were 25 years old. As a result, we have saved 25-30% of our income and invested aggressively over the years. We have a very healthy nest egg in the low- to mid-seven figures and no debt other than our home, which is very low interest and will be paid off before retirement. Our children have no student debt. My colleague says we are \u201cpostponing\u201d our lives and creating tax problems for when we retire. We have never felt like we have missed out on anything by saving and have lived a full life but is there such a thing as saving too much?\n\nSigned,\n\nLive for today or save for tomorrow?\n\nDear Live for Today or Save for Tomorrow,\n\nI\u2019ll start with the answer you may not have expected: Yes, there is such a thing as saving too much money, financial advisers said. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you personally have saved too much, though.\n\nHaving an \u201coverfunded\u201d retirement isn\u2019t a bad problem to have, but it does raise the question: what are your goals for your finances, the present and your future, and are you meeting them? A big pile of money is great, but it\u2019s even better when you get to use it the way you want. There is no one right answer here, as the situation differs from person to person.\n\nThere is a balance between saving for the future and living for today, and sometimes, people do overcompensate in one area.\n\n\u201cIt is important for each person to think about this and determine where their balancing point is,\u201d said Mark Beaver, partner and senior financial adviser at Keeler & Nadler. There are scenarios where people do so much planning and saving for the future, and then they\u2019re robbed of that future for unforeseen and devastating reasons. Or they live it up in the moment and spend more than they save in the present, only to end up with little to no money to rely on in their old age, he said.\n\nSee:I\u2019m a 32-year-old stay-at-home mom, and my husband earns $150,000 a year. Will I ever be able to enjoy a retirement?\n\nYour colleague isn\u2019t wrong to suggest that some people do \u201cpostpone\u201d their lives in the name of aggressively saving, but that could only happen if you\u2019re living so frugally today that you\u2019re not enjoying your life now. Some people save aggressively because they\u2019re afraid of running out of money later in life, said Christopher Woods, a financial adviser and founder of LifePoint Financial Group. \u201cThere are also others who are happy with their lifestyle and don\u2019t see how spending more will make them any happier,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s perfectly fine.\u201d\n\nBut now for the good news: In your particular situation, it doesn\u2019t appear that you\u2019ve saved \u201ctoo much,\u201d said Joel Cundick, a financial adviser at Savant Capital. \u201cIf this couple has never felt like they are missing out and have had a full life thus far while accumulating a seven-figure balance sheet, that is the textbook definition of financial success,\u201d he said.\n\nThe balancing point, Beaver said, lies in how you feel about the present while you save for the future. \u201cIf it\u2019s keeping you from living the life you want right now because you\u2019re only looking at tomorrow, that is probably too much,\u201d he said. You should aim for financial security, but also put your money toward your values, which may include experiences, said Ashley Gragtmans, a behavioral financial adviser at Parsec Financial. \u201cIn general, I think it\u2019s hard to \u2018save too much,\u2019 but if you lack joy along the way, something needs to be re-evaluated,\u201d she said. You noted you have not had that problem.\n\nSo, what can you do from here?\n\nYour colleague may be right about setting yourself up for hefty tax bills in the future. How much is owed will depend on many factors, including how much you withdraw in a given year and how you diversify the accounts you withdraw from.\n\nFor example, you can use traditional retirement plans, which are funded with pretax dollars, as well as Roth accounts, which contain after-tax dollars. When it comes time to withdraw from those assets, the money from the traditional account will be taxed at ordinary income rates, while the latter will be a tax-free distribution. There are pros and cons to using these accounts though, so you have to see what is best for your situation. There are various alternatives and supplemental accounts as well to save money, such as taxable investment portfolios and life insurance. A financial adviser could help you avoid excessive tax burdens and strategize so that you\u2019re getting the most out of your money.\n\nAlthough you seem to have your nest egg in order, there are questions you can ask yourselves so that your retirement plan is well-rounded, said Nadine Burns, president and chief executive officer of A New Path Financial. Questions to consider include: do you have additional income to supplement your retirement, like a pension? When do you plan to claim Social Security and how does that fit into your expected retirement age? (If you retire before you claim, you\u2019ll have to draw down some of those assets before you start receiving benefits.) Are there any health issues in the family, such as dementia, that may warrant long-term care planning? And what do you want to do with your retirement, so that the money you\u2019ve been saving is used well?\n\nAside from planning accordingly for the rest of your years, if you intend to leave money to loved ones or charities, you should have a clear estate plan written up so that your wishes are met, Cundick said. Some advisers have seen their super-saver clients become \u201csuper-givers,\u201d like Leon LaBrecque, chief growth officer at Sequoia Financial Group. \u201cI love saving,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, money is nothing but a piece of paper with a picture of a dead president on it until you get rid of it. You can save it for you or save it for others.\u201d Charitable giving can also lessen the burden of tax obligations.\n\nAlso see: All the tax-friendly ways retirees can donate to charity\n\nHaving an estate plan ensures your hard-earned savings are being used the way you intended them to be used. However, you should consult with a financial professional, especially as rules can change. For example, the Secure Act passed in December eliminated the stretch IRA provision for inherited accounts, which could force loved ones to pay much more in taxes than you\u2019d like.\n\nBut back to the present: Make sure to continue enjoying life now while you save and prepare for retirement, said Michael Simmons, director of financial planning at Transitions Wealth Management. \u201cAt some point, you may have the financial resources but lack the health or even the desire for things such as travel,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the meantime, you should pat yourselves on the back, said Liz Gillette, a financial adviser at MainStreet Planning.\n\n\u201cFor most of us, investing versus spending is a competing priority that we work to manage. Living life in the now because life is uncertain but saving/investing enough so we don\u2019t compromise our future selves,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as that money can be used in ways that serves their values and priorities, I certainly wouldn\u2019t say they have saved \u2018too much.\u2019\u201d\n\nLetters are edited for length and style.\n\nHave a question about your own retirement savings?

I am 34 and make $96,000, she is 33 and makes $45,000. We have a 1.5 year old at home and plans for another in the near future. I have around $37,000 in student loans left and we just opened a 30-year mortgage a year ago. We have $15,000 in a traditional savings account, I have a pension through public education, and she has a 401(k) with around $20,000 in it from an old job and another one with a few thousand in it she opened a year ago. She also has a Roth IRA a family member opened for her recently with $5,000. To muddy the waters, I will be searching for a new job next year which will mean a move with all the trappings (new mortgage, etc.), that will put me somewhere around $130,000. She is planning to stay home with the kids for a few years or work part time, if possible.\n\nOur total take home/spending difference averages around $1,000 each month that we can save, invest or put toward debt. The student loan has a 5.625% interest rate but is suspended right now because of the CARES Act. The payment is $242 a month. Our mortgage balance is $192,000 and that monthly payment is $1,427 but we pay a little extra each month. We\u2019d love to refinance but the closing costs aren\u2019t worth it since we are likely selling it next spring or summer. We got a good deal in a seller\u2019s market in our Nebraska town and did some minor upgrades to the house. I realize after two years of interest, initial closing costs, maintenance, etc. we will still probably be losing money on this house, but I\u2019m optimistic we will walk away with at least $20,000 cash when the sale is complete.\n\nMy biggest concern is purchasing another house next summer and how to balance that with paying off this student loan and starting to save for retirement. Should we just sit tight and squirrel money away for a down payment rather than trying to invest in the current uncertain market? I\u2019m nervous to tie a lot of it into retirement accounts that I can\u2019t touch, as well, even though I\u2019m tempted to open a Roth IRA for myself and fully fund it for 2019 given the extended tax deadline this year. Doing that right now would leave us less than $10,000 in liquid cash.\n\nThanks again,\n\nB.C.\n\nSee: I have a seven-figure nest egg \u2014 am I saving too much for retirement?\n\nDear B.C.,\n\nFirst, a congratulations is in order \u2014 you\u2019ve got money in the bank, you\u2019re paying extra toward your mortgage, you\u2019ve got some retirement savings already stashed away as well as a pension and you\u2019re focusing on your finances. That\u2019s all great stuff.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts to this question but you\u2019re certainly not alone \u2014 many people in their 20s, 30s and beyond worry about how to save for retirement while they\u2019re juggling so many other present-day financial responsibilities, such as paying down student debt, starting a family, paying for child care and enjoying their lives at least a little bit.\n\nThe good news is: You can, and should, still be putting money away for retirement, but financial advisers had a few other suggestions for you first.\n\nIdeally, you should start by beefing up your emergency savings. I know that probably sounds overwhelming considering you\u2019re talking about your mortgage, student debt and retirement savings, but because you expect to do so much within the next year or so, having more in your emergency savings will pay off. The $15,000 is a good start, which means you won\u2019t have to dedicate all of your extra cash flow to this type of account, but advisers suggest you have at least three months\u2019 worth of expenses \u2014 and probably closer to six months if your wife will be staying home for a few years, said Mary Beth Storjohann, chief marketing officer and partner at Abacus Wealth Partners. She suggests splitting that extra $1,000 so that half of it goes toward an emergency savings. The other half can go to a Roth individual retirement account, which, if you dedicated the $500 a month for a full year you\u2019d hit the maximum contribution limit of $6,000 (also depending when you start contributing and if you make the final payment for that tax year by Tax Day).\n\nA hearty emergency savings account might seem boring or unnecessary, but especially in this moment of time, it\u2019s crucial.\n\n\u201cIn this environment, nobody\u2019s job is safe,\u201d said Peter Palion, a financial adviser and founder of Master Plan Advisory. So many people have lost their jobs, suffered a reduction in wages or had unexpected expenses as a result of the current crisis that made them financially vulnerable.\n\nAs for your student loans, you might have some options. Because you are in public education, you may qualify for student loan forgiveness. There are a few types, including one specifically for teachers who worked full time for five complete and consecutive years in a low-income elementary or secondary school. The program would forgive up to $17,500 on your loan. Here\u2019s more on that. Although that sounds like a dream, public service forgiveness loans haven\u2019t always worked for everyone \u2014 so you might want to keep tackling these debts as you go. You don\u2019t want to put that debt repayment off just to find out you didn\u2019t qualify because of some paperwork loophole.\n\nThere are a lot of questions surrounding your relocation and potential new job, and some of them you may not even know the answers to yet. You should consider factors such as: what your current home will sell for, how much your future home will cost, the fees associated with both of those transactions and the unexpected costs during and after the move. This is yet another reason why you should focus on building up your liquid cash reserve, Palion said.\n\nAlso, when you make that job switch, remember to look through employee benefits. Higher salaries are great, but you should also dive into health care coverage and retirement account benefits, Storjohann said.\n\nStaying at home to take care of the family is a hard job, and that transition will also affect your finances. If you ended up earning $130,000 but your wife stopped working for now, you\u2019d actually see a loss of income around $10,000 a year. You and your wife should talk through that possibility and the finances that will come along with that scenario. The first few conversations should be around the logistics of these changes, Storjohann said. \u201cFrom there, once you shape your goals, it\u2019s like building your own financial plan,\u201d she said. Plan to meet on a monthly or biweekly basis to understand the household\u2019s spending and saving as you pursue these goals and then eventually achieve them. Create a financial spreadsheet or statement where you can update your numbers every six months, so that you clearly understand where your money is going, how it\u2019s working for you and where you can go from there.\n\nAnd even while your wife is staying at home with the kids, she can still be contributing to a retirement plan through a spousal IRA. A recent study found families don\u2019t often account for the nonworking spouse when relying on one income for retirement savings. What one does with old employer-sponsored plans is usually a personal preference, but she may want to consolidate her old 401(k) plan into her current plan or eventually roll them over into an IRA. The key in this particular situation however is to ensure she is getting the same high quality fund options (if not better) and low management fees.\n\nAlso see: I\u2019m a 32-year-old stay-at-home mom, and my husband earns $150,000 a year. Will I ever be able to enjoy a retirement?\n\nSaving for college is important for families, but it probably shouldn\u2019t be prioritized before retirement.\n\n\u201cYes, they should be thinking about college funds but not at the expense of their retirement,\u201d said Juan Ros, a financial adviser at Forum Financial Management. For retirement, \u201cthere are no loans you can get, no scholarships \u2014 it is just whatever you have.\u201d If you want to dedicate some of your extra cash flow to college savings, though, a 529 plan would be a good start. And it doesn\u2019t hurt if you are expecting a second child soon. \u201cWith one child, it is going to be expensive,\u201d Palion said. \u201cWith two, it is going to be twice as expensive.\u201d If you start with $50 a month, you\u2019ll have a \u201cpretty sum of money\u201d in 18 years, Palion said. Comparatively, if you started saving farther down the road, you\u2019d have to hike up your contributions substantially to make up for the lost time. There are also other types of accounts, including Coverdell, custodial accounts and savings bonds. Here\u2019s a breakdown of some of the pros and cons of each avenue.\n\nThere are a few tasks you should also consider, though you didn\u2019t mention them here, Ros said. Because you have a young family, and there is the possibility that they will rely on you for their major source of income, you should look into an estate plan, such as a will or trust depending on your state\u2019s rules. You and your wife should also get powers of attorney, so that you can dictate who your children\u2019s guardians are. And while you may have group life insurance through your employer, you should consider some type of term life insurance with a policy of at least $1 million, Ros said. At your age, that policy should be relatively cheap. Although it will cost a few thousand dollars most likely, getting these affairs in order would protect your family in the event something happened.\n\nAs for your question regarding how to save for retirement: Having a pension through your public education job is a huge win, advisers said. You may also have access to a 403(b) plan, and if you do, you should consider contributing to it \u2014 especially if there is some sort of employer match. Your wife won\u2019t be able to participate in her 401(k) plans once she stops working at those jobs, but you both can work on investing in IRAs. There are traditional IRAs, which are funded with pretax dollars, and Roth IRAs, which are funded with after-tax dollars. There are advantages to both types of accounts, though it also doesn\u2019t hurt to diversify so that you have options in retirement to save on taxes.\n\nYou definitely have a lot going on but you\u2019re on the right path.\n\nHave a question about your own retirement savings?

Well, my retirement income is $16,600 per year. Is there a place I can go where the sky is blue and the water warm? Where can an average person like me retire?\n\nR.S.R.\n\nDear R.S.R.,\n\nI hear you \u2014 it\u2019s frustrating to read about people who get to live large in retirement when your reality (and frankly, most Americans\u2019 reality) is very different. The average Social Security retirement benefit in 2019 was $1,470 a month or $17,640 a year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Even with benefits of that size, though, there are options for a beachy retirement. Here are affordable spots at the beach for you to consider.\n\nOn the beach in Gulfport, Miss. iStock\n\nIf you\u2019d like to stay in the U.S.: Gulfport, Miss. (with some part-time work)\n\nI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat this: It\u2019s tough to live in the U.S. on $16,600 a year, especially in a beach town. That said, if you can supplement your life with some part-time work, it\u2019s doable.\n\nOne town for you to consider: Gulfport, Miss., which is one of the most affordable beach towns in the country.\n\nThe cost of living is nearly 19% lower than the U.S. average, according to Sperling\u2019s Best Places, and you can find small apartments to rent for under $600 a month. Plus, Mississippi is tax friendly to retirees, with SmartAsset noting that \u201cMississippi exempts all forms of retirement income from taxation, including Social Security benefits, income from an IRA, income from a 401(k) and any pension income.\n\nGulfport offers warm weather and nice beaches \u2014 and other perks, too. \u201cThis city is having a serious comeback moment \u2026 and there\u2019s a bounty of cool, hip new businesses,\u201d Vogue writes of Gulfport. \u201cOne gem in particular is Fishbone Alley: a funky destination that backs up to a handful of restaurants and bars, boasting original local art along the buildings.\u201d The downsides include muggy, hot summers and the risk of hurricanes.\n\nMazatl\u00e1n, if you\u2019re willing to live abroad. iStock\n\nIf you want to stay close to the U.S.: Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico\n\nHeading south of the border can help you stretch your funds more effectively than is generally possible in the U.S. \u2014 and you\u2019d be far from the only American there. Indeed, as I reported last year, plenty of people receive their U.S. Social Security checks in Mexico (behind only two countries, Canada and Japan). Of course, certain parts of Mexico have downsides including hot summers and high crime.\n\nBut, as I wrote in this recent column for a woman looking to retire near the ocean on between $800 and $1,000 a month, there are some places that fit within your budget. I suggested she consider Mazatl\u00e1n \u2014 a Pacific coastal resort town with \u201ccobblestone streets, neoclassical and French Baroque architecture and cultural amenities like theater and art galleries.\u201d (We also talked to a woman who retired to Mazatl\u00e1n on $1,000 a month, and she doesn\u2019t feel she\u2019s pinching pennies too much.) Note that Mazatl\u00e1n itself is in the state of Sinaloa, which the U.S. government advises Americans against traveling to, though this exempts parts of Mazatl\u00e1n, as we have reported.\n\nOne hiccup: There are monetary requirements for Mexican residency that you may not currently meet, as they stipulate a certain monthly pension income or a minimum value held in investments (these numbers change with the exchange rate and other factors, but you can read up on that here.) Thus, if all your $16,600 will come from Social Security and you have no savings and investments, retirement there might be a problem; if, however, you have a larger investment account to draw from, it can work.\n\nHow these Americans save money in retirement: They live in Spain\n\nCoastal Panama. iStock\n\nIf you\u2019re up for an adventure: Pedasi, Panama\n\nThis chilled-out town on the Pacific Ocean, roughly 4\u00bd hours from Panama City, is \u201cunpretentious and laid-back,\u201d writes Lonely Planet, adding: \u201cPedasi has streets lined with tiled colonials and leafy spaces. For years this sleepy retreat came to life only at festival times. But outsiders are discovering the big appeal of small-town life and relatively unspoiled beaches.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, this town is small, with fewer than 5,000 residents, and rural, but as International Living puts it, \u201cPedasi is rural living at its best.\u201d It\u2019s surrounded by green pastures and grazing cattle yet lies within a 10-minute drive of the ocean, according to International Living, which adds that \u201cmiles of unspoiled beach and little development\u201d are found locally.\n\nYou can also live here on your budget, though it may, as International Living notes, require \u201cboots-on-the-ground investigating with the locals\u201d or moving a bit farther from the ocean to get a better deal on rent. (Though, they point out, paying $500 a month for an apartment is doable.) Even if you pay a bit more in rent, you\u2019ll benefit from Panama\u2019s pensionado program for retirees (which has income requirements of roughly $1,000 a month) as it offers tons of discounts for older people on everything from entertainment to prescriptions.\n\nLetters are edited for clarity and length."}]}}}
